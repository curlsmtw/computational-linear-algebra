1. Write Python code to create a (4 x 8) matrix of integers from 1 to 32. 
Extract the element corresponding to your birth month. Extract the element
corresponding to your birth date. Print the output.

2. Write Python code to create a (10 x 10) matrix C of integers from 1 to
100.
(a) Extract the submatrix C1 comprising the first five rows and five
columns.
(b) Cut original matrix in 4 blocks such that: C1 is submatrix comprising
the first five rows and five columns; C2 submatrix comprising the first five
rows and last five columns; C3 is submatrix comprising the last five rows
and first five columns. C4 is submatrix comprising the last five rows and
five columns.
Rearrange the blocks to get a newM atrix =

| C4 C3 |
| C2 C1 |

3. Create two (4 x 4) matrices: a matrix of all ones and a diagonal matrix
where diagonal elements are 1, 4, 9, and 16. Perform premultiplying and
posmultiplying of the matrix of ones by the diagonal matrix. Make a
conclusion about the result.
