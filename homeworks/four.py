# 1. Consider the following vectors in R^3:
# u1 = [ 1
#       3
#      −2]
# u2 = [5
#       1
#       4 ]
#  y = [1
#       4
#       5]

# (a) Find the best approximation of y in the subspace W = Span {u1, u2},
# which is the projection of y onto the subspace spanned by u1 and
# u2.


# (b) Visualize the subspace spanned by the orthogonalized vectors and the
# projection of y onto this subspace in a 3D plot. Include the following
# in your plot:
# • The vectors u1 and u2,
# • The vector y,
# • The projection of y onto the subspace spanned by u1 and u2,
# • The orthogonal complement of y relative to the subspace.


# 2. For the 4 × 3 matrix A = [ 3 −5 1,
#                               1 1 1,
#                               −1 5 −2,
#                               3 −7 8],
# find an orthonormal basis for Col(A).
