Sport ranking

Objective: Visualize the data available for the first half of the Southeastern Conference
football season in the form of a directed graph. Use this data to predict future
sports rankings.

Table 1: SEC-East Football Scores.
FL(29)-KY(21)   FL(34)-TN(3)    FL(38)-SC(27)
TN(14)-GA(43)   TN(41)-SC(21)   KY(7)-SC(24)
KY(0)-GA(21)    KY(29)-MIZ(7)   GA(30)-VAN(6)
GA(17)-SC(21)   MIZ(34)-SC(14)  MIZ(14)-VAN(21)

Directions:
1. Create a directed graph where a directed edge from vertex vi to vertex
vj represents a victory for team i over team j. Note that an edge from
vi to vj may exist without the existence of an edge from vj to vi. Assign
weights to edges based on score differences. For example, assign a weight
of 8 to the edge representing a Florida victory over Kentucky, where the
score difference was 8 points.

2. Construct the adjacency matrix A corresponding to your directed graph.
Is matrix A symmetric? Provide a justification for your answer.

3. Use the provided score differences from the games to develop a ranking
system for the teams. Explain the methodology you use to convert the
graph data into rankings.

Reflection:
Use a software to complete this assignment. Provide your code as part of
the submission. Submit a short (1-2 pages) project report summarizing your
approach, including a description of the directed graph you created, the adjacency matrix, 
an explanation of how you ranked the teams, a summary of your
findings and any conclusions you can draw from your analysis.
